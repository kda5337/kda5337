# My Project Plan

***Note:*** This document is written merely as an illustrative example, and does not provide any working guide to an actual project.  

### Proposal 
--- 
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images.  
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and other open source softwares.  

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection):
